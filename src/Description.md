diffence between classpath and path 
--------------------------------------
1).Path is an environment variable which is used by the operating system to find the executables.

Classpath is an environment variable which is used by the Java compiler to find the path, of classes.ie in J2EE we give the path of jar files.


2).PATH is nothing but setting up an environment for operating system. Operating System will look in this PATH for executables.

Classpath is nothing but setting up the environment for Java. Java will use to find compiled classes

3).Path refers to the system while classpath refers to the Developing Envornment.

In path we set the path of executables while in
classpath we set path of jars for compiling classes.

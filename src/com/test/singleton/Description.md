Eager Singleton
----------------
Advantages: Simple and thread-safe.
Disadvantages: Instance is created even if it might not be used, which can be inefficient if the object is resource-heavy.

Lazy Singleton
---------------
Advantages: Instance is created only when needed.
Disadvantages: Not thread-safe. Multiple threads could create multiple instances simultaneously in the absence of synchronization.

Thread-Safe Singleton with Synchronization
---------------------------------------------
Advantages: Thread-safe.
Disadvantages: Synchronization can impact performance, especially in scenarios with frequent calls to getInstance().

Double-Checked Locking
--------------------------
Advantages: Thread-safe and avoids the performance penalty of synchronizing every call to getInstance().
Disadvantages: More complex than simpler approaches. Requires the volatile keyword to ensure proper handling of the instance across threads.

Bill Pugh Singleton (Inner Static Helper Class)
----------------------------------------------------
Advantages: Thread-safe, lazy initialization, no synchronization overhead.
Disadvantages: None, it is widely considered the best approach for most use cases.


In Java, a static inner class, also called a static nested class, is loaded when you use the class name to access the class's static members instead of creating instances. Static inner classes are similar to regular inner classes, but you don't need to create an object for them. They can only access the outer class's static members and are the same as other top-level classes, but are nested for convenience. 


Singleton with Serialization
--------------------------------
Advantages: Prevents multiple instances from being created during serialization and deserialization.
Disadvantages: Slightly more complex due to serialization requirements.

If a singleton class implements Serializable, special care is needed to prevent the creation of multiple instances during deserialization. You need to override the readResolve() method to ensure that deserialization does not break the singleton property

Singleton with Reflection Protection
-------------------------------------

Advantages: Provides protection against reflection attacks.
Disadvantages: Slightly more complex due to reflection handling.


Reflection can break singleton implementations by accessing private constructors and creating new instances. To prevent this, you can throw an exception in the constructor if the instance already exists.
